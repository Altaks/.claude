# Claude Skill Curation

Generated from local `SKILL.md` frontmatter by `scripts/curate_claude_skills.py --write`.
Edit the script rules, then regenerate this file when skill inventory changes.

## How to use this index

1. Start broad work with T0/T1 skills, then add a specialist only when the target platform or tool is clear.
1. Prefer coverage anchors for GRC, AI/LLM, IoT/embedded, mainframe, telecom/5G, SAP/ERP, and supply-chain work.
1. Treat T3 skills as exact-match playbooks. They are useful, but noisy for open-ended prompts.
1. For offensive or simulation skills, confirm authorization and environment before acting.
