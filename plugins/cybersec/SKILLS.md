# Claude Code Skills

This directory contains 872 skills that activate on demand based on what you're working on. Skills extend Claude Code without permanently consuming context.

Every skill follows the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) — a `<name>/SKILL.md` file with `name`/`description` frontmatter — so the same directory is portable across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode (mirrored to `.agents/skills/` by `scripts/sync-skills.sh`). Conformance is enforced in CI by `scripts/validate_claude_skills.py`.
